# Plex Renamer

A quick little script to help me rename some files for Plex.

Performs a search against TMDB to find the TMBD ID and puts it in the filename.


## Usage

All the normal stuff: venv, pip install requirements, etc.

Also, create `API_KEY` file next to `movie_tmdb.py` or as an env var.

Then run `sudo /path/to/venv/bin/python movie_tmdb.py PATH`.
